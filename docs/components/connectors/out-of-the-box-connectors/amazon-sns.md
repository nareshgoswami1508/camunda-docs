The **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** Connector is an outbound Connector that allows you to connect your BPMN service with [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to send messages.

## Prerequisites

To use the **Amazon SNS Connector**, you need to have an SNS Topic, IAM key, and secret pair with the `sns:Publish` policy relative to your SNS.

:::note
It is highly recommended not to expose your AWS IAM credentials as plain text. Instead, use Camunda secrets. Refer to an [appendix entry](#how-do-i-store-aws-iam-secrets-for-my-sns-connector) and the [SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-using-identity-based-policies.html#sns-policy-keys) to learn more.
:::

## Create an Amazon SNS Connector task

To use the **Amazon SNS Connector** in your process, either change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the wrench-shaped **Change type** context menu icon, or create a new Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu. Follow our [guide to using Connectors](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md) to learn more.

## Make your Amazon SNS Connector for sending messages executable

To make your Amazon SNS Connector for sending messages executable, take the following steps:

1. Choose an applicable authentication type from the **Authentication** dropdown. Learn more about authentication types in the related [appendix entry](#aws-authentication-types).
2. Set the relevant IAM key and secret pair in the **Authentication** section. For example, `{{secrets.MY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY}}`. The value can be plain text, but this is not recommended due to security concerns.
3. In the **Topic Properties** section, set the topic ARN of your SNS topic as well as its region.
4. In the **Input message data** section, fill out the field **Message** with the data you would like to publish to the topic. The field requires FEEL input.
5. (Optional) In the **Input message data** section, fill out the field **Message attributes** to set optional message metadata. This field requires FEEL input. Refer to the relevant [appendix](#what-are-the-message-attributes-and-how-can-i-set-them) section to find out more about this field.
6. (Optional) In the **Input message data** section, fill out the field **Subject** to set optional message subject. FEEL input of the field is optional. Length must be less than 100 characters.

## Amazon SNS Connector response

The **Amazon SNS Connector** returns the SNS message identifier of a newly created message.
The response contains a `messageId` variable.

You can use an output mapping to map the response:

1. Use **Result Variable** to store the response in a process variable. For example, `myResultVariable`.
2. Use **Result Expression** to map fields from the response into process variables. For example:

```
= {
  "createdMessageID": response.messageId
}
```

## Appendix & FAQ

### What are the message attributes and how can I set them?

Amazon SNS lets you include structured metadata (such as timestamps, geospatial data, signatures, and identifiers) with messages using message attributes.
The **Amazon SNS Connector** allows you to include non-binary message attributes in the **Input message data** section. The message attribute value must be composed to be compliant with Amazon SNS [message attribute data format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-attributes.html).

Example of a valid message attribute as a FEEL value:

```
= {
  "timestamp":{
    "StringValue":today(),
    "DataType":"String"
  },
  "messageSubmittedBy":{
    "StringValue":"user12345",
    "DataType":"String"
  }
}
```

### How do I store AWS IAM secrets for my SNS Connector?

It is highly recommended storing your secret AWS IAM credentials as Camunda secrets. Follow our documentation on [managing secrets](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) to learn more.

### AWS authentication types

There are two options to authenticate the Connector with AWS:

- Choose **Credentials** in the **Authentication** dropdown if you have a valid pair of access and secret keys provided by your AWS account administrator. This option is applicable for both SaaS and Self-Managed users.
- Choose **Default Credentials Chain (Hybrid/Self-Managed only)** in the **Authentication** dropdown if your system is configured as an implicit authentication mechanism, such as role-based authentication, credentials supplied via environment variables, or files on target host. This option is applicable only for Self-Managed or hybrid distribution. This approach uses the [Default Credential Provider Chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) to resolve required credentials.

<TabItem value='inbound'>

The **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) inbound Connector** is a Connector that allows you to start or continue
a BPMN process triggered by an [Amazon SNS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home) notification.

## Create an Amazon SNS inbound Connector task

1. Start building your BPMN diagram. You can use the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** with either a **Start Event** or **Intermediate Catch Event**.
2. Select the applicable element and change its template to an **Amazon SNS Connector**.
3. Fill in all required properties.
4. Complete your BPMN diagram.
5. Deploy the diagram to activate the webhook.
6. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab in the properties panel to observe the webhook URL.

## Make your Amazon SNS inbound Connector for receiving notifications executable

1. In the **Subscription Configuration** section, configure the **Subscription ID**. By default, **Subscription ID** is pre-filled with a random value. This value will be a part of the topic subscription URL.
2. Set the **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** value to **any** if the process may be triggered by any topic, or **Specific topic(s)** if you wish to allow-list only certain topics to start a new BPMN process.
3. If you have chosen the **Specific topic(s)**, you have to list comma-separated topics in the field **Topic ARN(s)** as well. In that case, the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** will auto-approve each qualified subscription request.
4. In the section **Activation**, configure **Condition** when the Amazon SNS topic can trigger a new BPMN process. The following example will trigger a new BPMN process for every notification with a subject _Start BPMN_: `=(request.body.Subject = "Start BPMN")`.
5. In the section **Variable mapping** fill the field **Result variable** to store the response in a process variable. For example, `myResultVariable`.
6. In the section **Variable expression** fill the field to map specific fields from the response into process variables using [FEEL](/components/modeler/feel/what-is-feel.md).
   The following example will extract both message and subject from Amazon SNS message: `={message: request.body.Message, subject: request.body.Subject}`.

When using the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** with an **Intermediate Catch Event**, fill in the **Correlation key (process)** and **Correlation key (payload)**.

- **Correlation key (process)** is a FEEL expression that defines the correlation key for the subscription. This corresponds to the **Correlation key** property of a regular **Message Intermediate Catch Event**.
- **Correlation key (payload)** is a FEEL expression used to extract the correlation key from the incoming message. This expression is evaluated in the Connector Runtime and the result is used to correlate the message.

For example, given that your correlation key is defined with `myCorrelationKey` process variable, and the request body contains `"MessageAttributes": {"attrName1" : {"Type":"String","Value":"attrVal"}}`, your correlation key settings will look like this:

- **Correlation key (process)**: `=myCorrelationKey`
- **Correlation key (payload)**: `=request.body.MessageAttributes.attrName1.Value`

Learn more about correlation keys in the [messages guide](../../../concepts/messages).

## Activate the Amazon SNS inbound Connector by deploying your diagram

Once you click the **Deploy** button, your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** will be activated and publicly available.

URLs of the exposed **Amazon SNS Inbound Connector** adhere to the following pattern:

`https://<base URL>/inbound/<subscription ID>`

- `<base URL>` is the URL of Connectors component deployment. When using the Camunda 8 SaaS offering, this will typically contain your cluster region and cluster ID.
- `<subscription ID>` is the ID (path) you configured in the properties of your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector**.

If you make changes to your **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** configuration, you need to redeploy the BPMN diagram for the changes to take effect.

When you click on the event with **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** applied to it, a new **Webhooks** tab will appear in the properties panel.
This tab displays the URL of the **Amazon SNS inbound Connector** for every cluster where you have deployed your BPMN diagram.

:::note
The **Webhooks** tab is only supported in Web Modeler as part of the Camunda 8 SaaS offering.
You can still use Amazon SNS inbound Connectors in Desktop Modeler, or with Camunda 8 Self-Managed.
In that case, Amazon SNS inbound Connector deployments and URLs will not be displayed in Modeler.

## Wiring with Amazon SNS

1. Sign in to the [Amazon SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home).
2. On the navigation panel, choose **Topics**.
3. Choose the **Create** subscription.
4. In the **Protocol** drop-down list, select **HTTPS**.
5. In the **Endpoint** box, paste in the URL of the subscription found in at the **Webhooks** tab of your BPMN
   diagram that you want the topic to send messages. Then, choose **Create subscription**.
6. The confirmation message is displayed. Choose **Close**. Your new subscription's **Subscription ID**
   displays **PendingConfirmation**. Shortly after it will be confirmed by the BPMN process assuming **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** contains the SNS topic ARN.

## Security considerations

### Access control

The field **Allow to receive messages from topic(s)** and related **Topic ARN(s)** allows you to control which Amazon SNS topics can trigger a BPMN process.
You can also achieve the same outcome by specifying **Condition** in the **Activation** section. For example, given **Topic ARN(s)** equals `arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:1234567890:SNSWebhook`,
is the same as **Condition** equals `=(request.body.TopicArn = "arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:1234567890:SNSWebhook")`.

### Integrity

Each Amazon SNS message is digitally signed with an AWS private key. The body of a message contains a digital signature of
the entire content. The **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Inbound Connector** verifies every message against
the Amazon SNS public certificate to ensure the message is of known origin and has not been tampered with.
