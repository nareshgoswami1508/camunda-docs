---

The **GitLab Connector** is an outbound Connector that allows you to connect your BPMN service with [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) to manage GitLab issues and releases.

## Prerequisites

To use the **GitLab Connector**, you must have a GitLab instance and an [access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) of a user
or a service account on whose behalf a BPMN process will be executed.

:::note
It is highly recommended not to expose your GitLab access token credentials as plain text. Instead, use Camunda secrets.
Refer to our documentation on [managing secrets](/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) to learn more.

## Create a GitLab Connector task

To use the **GitLab Connector** in your process, either change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the wrench-shaped **Change type** context menu icon, or create a new Connector task by using the **Append Connector** context menu. Follow our [guide to using Connectors](/components/connectors/use-connectors/index.md) to learn more.

## Add endpoint and authentication

In the **HTTP Endpoint** section, provide a **GitLab base URL**, i.e. `https://gitlab.mycorp.com`, and a **GitLab access token**.

## Handle Connector response

The **GitLab Connector** is a protocol Connector, meaning it is built on top of the **HTTP REST Connector**, therefore
handling response is still applicable [as described](/components/connectors/protocol/rest.md#response).
