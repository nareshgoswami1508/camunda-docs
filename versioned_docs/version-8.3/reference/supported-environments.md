:::note
The versions listed on this page are the minimum version required if appended with a `+`.

Pay attention to where the `+` falls, as most of our dependencies follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver), where `x.y.z` correspond to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Higher or more recent versions will be compatible with Camunda, with respect to semver.

For example, 1.2+ means support for the minor version 2, and any higher minors (1.3, 1.4, etc.) and patches (1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc.), but not majors, like 2.x.

## Camunda 8 Self-Managed

We highly recommend running Camunda 8 Self-Managed in a Kubernetes environment. We provide officially supported [Helm Charts](/self-managed/platform-deployment/helm-kubernetes/overview.md) for this. Please follow the [Installation Guide](/self-managed/platform-deployment/overview.md) to learn more about installation possibilities.

Requirements for the components can be seen below:

### Helm chart version matrix

The core Camunda components have a unified fixed release schedule following the [release policy](./release-policy.md). However, some of the applications have their own schedule. The following compatibility matrix gives an overview of the different versions with respect to the Helm chart versions.

| Helm chart | Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist | Optimize | Web Modeler | Connectors |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 8.3.x      | 8.3.x                    | 8.3.x    | 8.3.x       | >= 8.3.0   |
| 8.2.x      | 8.2.x                    | 3.10.x   | 8.2.x       | >= 0.18.0  |
| 8.1.x      | 8.1.x                    | 3.9.x    | N/A         | N/A        |
| 8.0.x      | 8.0.x                    | 3.9.x    | N/A         | N/A        |
